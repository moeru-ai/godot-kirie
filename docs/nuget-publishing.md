# NuGet Publishing

This lane publishes
[`GdKirie.EventaAdapter`](../packages/GdKirie.EventaAdapter/README.md) and
[`GdKirie.Platform`](../packages/GdKirie.Platform/README.md). It is separate
from addon zip publishing and browser-side npm publishing.

The package targets `net10.0` only because the upstream Eventa .NET package
targets `net10.0`. Projects targeting `net8.0` or `net9.0` should expect
restore or build failures when referencing the adapter. .NET 8 LTS reaches end
of support on 2026-11-10, so Kirie does not add a compatibility layer that
copies Eventa protocol logic around the upstream target framework.

## Local Validation

Restore, build, test, and pack the .NET workspace:

```sh
mise x -- dotnet restore GdKirie.slnx
mise x -- dotnet build GdKirie.slnx --configuration Release
mise x -- dotnet test --solution GdKirie.slnx --configuration Release --no-build
mise x -- dotnet pack packages/GdKirie.EventaAdapter/GdKirie.EventaAdapter.csproj --configuration Release --no-build
mise x -- dotnet pack packages/GdKirie.Platform/GdKirie.Platform.csproj --configuration Release --no-build
```

The Eventa adapter includes a NuGet `contentFiles` source bridge that connects the
addon-shipped `KirieClient.cs` to the adapter without placing Eventa source in
`addons/kirie`.

The repository `global.json` opts `dotnet test` into
Microsoft.Testing.Platform, which is required for this xUnit v3 test project on
.NET 10 SDKs.

## GitHub Actions Publishing

The `Publish NuGet Packages` workflow publishes both packages for pushed `v*`
tags after verifying that the tagged commit is on `main`. It uses NuGet Trusted
Publishing to exchange a GitHub Actions OIDC token for a short-lived NuGet API
key; do not configure a long-lived NuGet API key for this workflow.

Create a Trusted Publishing policy on NuGet.org for the user or organization
that owns both packages. Configure the GitHub repository identity as:

- Repository owner: `moeru-ai`
- Repository: `godot-kirie`
- Workflow file: `nuget-release.yml`
- Environment: empty

The policy applies to every package owned by the selected NuGet policy owner.
Choose that owner deliberately, then configure a repository Actions variable
named `NUGET_USER` with the NuGet profile username used by the login action, not
an email address. The workflow rejects a missing username before requesting an
OIDC credential.
