# Addon Release

GitHub Release addon publishing is handled by the `Addon Release` workflow.
This flow is separate from npm publishing, which is only for browser-side
workspace packages such as `@gd-kirie/ipc` and `@gd-kirie/ipc-eventa`.

It is also separate from the NuGet publishing lane for .NET adapter packages.
Keep addon zip packaging focused on `addons/kirie`; desktop Godot CEF artifacts
are outside the default Kirie addon zip.

## Intended Artifact

The downloadable addon should be produced as a build artifact, not by using
GitHub's source archive directly.

The public zip should unpack to a standard Godot addon layout:

```text
addons/kirie/
```

The public addon should include release native artifacts:

- `addons/kirie/libraries/android/Kirie-release.aar`
- `addons/kirie/ios/Kirie.debug.xcframework`
- `addons/kirie/ios/Kirie.release.xcframework`

The Android debug AAR and desktop Godot CEF artifacts should not be included in
the public addon zip. The iOS debug xcframework is included because Godot's
debug iOS export template needs a plugin binary built with matching Godot debug
template flags. In Godot's official iOS plugin build model this corresponds to
the `release_debug` target, so Kirie's debug artifact is built from the
`ReleaseDebug` Xcode configuration rather than from a full `Debug`
configuration.

The iOS artifacts live under `addons/kirie/ios` instead of
`res://ios/plugins` because Kirie publishes one standard addon tree for all
platforms. The addon export plugin injects the selected xcframework and native
initialization code through Godot's `EditorExportPlugin` Apple embedded platform
hooks, so users do not need a separate project-local `.gdip` shim.

## User Install Flow

Users should download `kirie-addon.zip` from a GitHub Release asset, not the
repository source archive.

The zip is rooted at:

```text
addons/kirie/
```

To install it, extract the zip into the root of a Godot project so the final
layout is:

```text
res://addons/kirie/
```

If the project already has an `addons` directory, merge the extracted `addons`
directory into the project root. Do not extract the zip inside the existing
`addons` directory, because that would create `addons/addons/kirie`.

After copying the files, enable Kirie from Godot's Project Settings Plugins tab.

## Local Pack Flow

Build native release artifacts and pack the public addon zip:

```sh
mise run build:addon-pack
```

The task stages a clean addon tree at:

```text
dist/addons/kirie/
```

and writes:

```text
dist/kirie-addon.zip
```

The zip is rooted so it unpacks into `addons/kirie`.

To check an already staged addon tree without rebuilding native artifacts:

```sh
mise run check:addon-pack
```

## GitHub Actions Flow

The `Addon Release` workflow has three intended modes:

- Manual default: run `workflow_dispatch` with `upload_release` disabled. The
  workflow builds `dist/kirie-addon.zip` and uploads it as a GitHub Actions
  artifact.
- Manual release upload: run `workflow_dispatch` with `upload_release` enabled
  and a `v*` `tag`. The workflow checks out that tag, builds the addon zip, and
  uploads it to the matching GitHub Release.
- Tag push: push a `v*` tag. The workflow builds the addon zip from that tag and
  uploads it to the matching GitHub Release.
