# `@gd-kirie/platform`

`@gd-kirie/platform` exposes browser-side desktop capabilities supplied by the
Godot host. Create the client from an existing `@gd-kirie/ipc-eventa` context.

```ts
import { createContext } from "@gd-kirie/ipc-eventa";
import { createPlatformClient } from "@gd-kirie/platform";

const eventa = createContext();
const platform = createPlatformClient(eventa.context);

await platform.hostWindow.setAlwaysOnTop(true);

const windowBounds = await platform.hostWindow.getBounds();
const displayBounds = await platform.hostWindow.getCurrentDisplayBounds();
const pointer = await platform.hostWindow.getPointerPosition();
const windowState = await platform.hostWindow.getState();
console.log(windowBounds, displayBounds, pointer, windowState);
eventa.dispose();
```

Request/response capabilities are methods on the returned client. Host-initiated
events are exported `@moeru/eventa` contracts; subscribe to them on the same
context and the returned function unsubscribes.

## External URLs

Use `openExternalUrl()` to open an absolute HTTP or HTTPS URL with the system
browser:

```ts
await platform.openExternalUrl("https://example.com");
```

The Godot host rejects relative URLs and other URI schemes. It uses
[`OS.shell_open()`](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/4.7/classes/class_os.html#class-os-method-shell-open)
to select the system browser.

Use `openApplicationDataDirectory()` to open the current Godot application's
data directory and receive its absolute path:

```ts
const path = await platform.openApplicationDataDirectory();
```

This capability does not accept an arbitrary path.

## Host window

- window position and size in screen coordinates
- current display position and size in screen coordinates
- pointer position relative to the host window, including while it is
  click-through
- pointer passthrough
- native move and resize gestures
- always-on-top
- centering on the current display
- visibility, focus, and minimized-state snapshots and change events

Pointer coordinates use host-window pixels and are not normalized to the
browser viewport. `getPointerPosition()` returns a single snapshot.

`getState()` returns one lifecycle snapshot and starts native state observation.
Call it once during setup. Later changes arrive as `hostWindowStateChanged`
events; subscribe with `context.on(hostWindowStateChanged, ({ body }) => ...)`
and call the returned function to unsubscribe.

## Global shortcuts

The macOS and Windows hosts can register a shortcut that remains active while
the Godot window is hidden or unfocused:

```ts
const shortcut = {
  keycode: 0x4b, // Godot Key.K
  shiftPressed: false,
  altPressed: false,
  ctrlPressed: false,
  metaPressed: false,
  commandOrControlAutoremap: true,
};

await platform.globalShortcuts.register(shortcut, ({ state }) => {
  console.log(state); // "pressed" or "released"
});

await platform.globalShortcuts.unregister(shortcut);
```

`keycode` uses Godot's logical `Key` values. Every modifier field is required;
`commandOrControlAutoremap` selects Command on macOS and Control on Windows.
One `onKeyEvent` handler receives both states; keyboard auto-repeat does not
produce extra calls.

## Desktop notifications

Desktop notifications are available on macOS 11 or later and on Windows 10
version 1607 or later:

```ts
import { notificationActivated } from "@gd-kirie/platform";

const stop = context.on(notificationActivated, ({ body }) => {
  if (body)
    console.log(`The user clicked ${body.id}`);
});

await platform.notifications.show({
  id: "assistant-answer-42",
  title: "AIRI",
  body: "The answer is ready.",
});

stop();
```

The first macOS `show()` requests permission. Windows does not show a
permission prompt; `show()` fails when notifications are turned off. IDs and
titles must not be empty. Click events end when the Platform host is disposed
and do not survive a cold launch. The Windows identity follows the running
executable. Linux backends are not implemented.

## System back

Android delivers the system Back button as a Platform event. The application
decides what Back means:

```ts
import { backRequested } from "@gd-kirie/platform";

const stop = context.on(backRequested, () => {
  console.log("The system Back button was pressed.");
});

stop();
```

To handle Back instead of letting Android close the application, set
[`SceneTree.quit_on_go_back`](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/4.7/classes/class_scenetree.html#class-scenetree-property-quit-on-go-back)
to `false`. The event is not emitted on platforms without a system Back button.
