# @gd-kirie/kirie

This package contains the Kirie plugin sources and platform-specific native
implementations.

`@gd-kirie/kirie` is a private workspace container for the Godot addon and
native plugin sources. It is not a public npm package and does not own a package
build pipeline. Native artifacts and the downloadable addon zip are built by the
repository-level mise tasks documented in
[docs/addon-release.md](../../docs/addon-release.md).

Current layout:

- `addon/addons/kirie`: Godot-facing plugin files
- `addon/addons/kirie/csharp`: C# wrapper files for Godot .NET projects
- `native/android`: Android implementation
- `native/ios`: iOS implementation

The goal of this package is to keep the Godot addon tree and native sources
close together while package-published JavaScript lives in the sibling
workspace packages.

## C# binding

`addon/addons/kirie/csharp/KirieClient.cs` exposes Kirie signals as idiomatic
C# events while keeping Godot `Callable` usage internal. Its default constructor
talks directly to the platform singleton:

```csharp
private readonly KirieClient _kirie = new();

public override void _Ready()
{
    _kirie.WebViewReady += OnWebViewReady;
    _kirie.TextReceived += OnTextReceived;
    _kirie.BinaryReceived += OnBinaryReceived;
    _kirie.DataReceived += OnDataReceived;
    _kirie.IpcError += GD.PushError;

    if (_kirie.IsAvailable)
    {
        _kirie.CreateWebView("res://src-web/dist/index.html");
    }
}
```

When a scene `KirieNode` owns the WebView, C# can borrow that existing node
without creating another owner or duplicating dynamic signal plumbing. This
example configures the scene node with `auto_create = false`, then lets C# start
the borrowed node's WebView after subscribing to its signals:

```csharp
private KirieClient? _kirie;

public override void _Ready()
{
    _kirie = KirieClient.FromNode(GetNode<Node>("Kirie"));
    _kirie.TextReceived += OnTextReceived;
    _kirie.CreateWebView();
}

public override void _ExitTree()
{
    _kirie?.Dispose();
    _kirie = null;
}
```

The borrowed node must outlive the client. Disposing the client disconnects its
C# callbacks but does not free the node or destroy its WebView; `KirieNode`
remains the scene-tree lifecycle owner.

## Pointer input forwarding

`KirieNode.pointer_input_forwarding_enabled` is an opt-in policy for pages that
forward browser pointer events through `@gd-kirie/ipc`. Forwarded events are
injected through Godot's input pipeline so controls behind the native WebView
can receive them. The WebView remains a full native surface; browser code
decides which events bubble to the forwarding listener and which interactive
regions retain their input.

C# uses the same scene-owned path. A client borrowed from `KirieNode` can set
the policy before creating its WebView:

```csharp
var kirie = KirieClient.FromNode(GetNode<Node>("Kirie"));
kirie.PointerInputForwardingEnabled = true;
kirie.CreateWebView();
```

The direct platform-singleton `KirieClient()` constructor has no scene owner to
receive synthetic input, so its `PointerInputForwardingEnabled` property is not
available. Use `FromNode` when pointer forwarding is required.

## WebView permission requests

Desktop Godot CEF projects can set
`godot_cef/security/default_permission_policy` to `Signal` (`2`). Kirie then
forwards each WebView request through `permission_requested`. The application
must check the exact origin and permission type before it resolves the request:

```csharp
var kirie = KirieClient.FromNode(GetNode<Node>("Kirie"));
kirie.PermissionRequested += (permissionType, origin, requestId) =>
{
    var trusted = permissionType == "microphone" && origin == "https://app.example";
    if (trusted)
    {
        kirie.GrantPermission(requestId);
        return;
    }

    kirie.DenyPermission(requestId);
};
```

Each request ID is single-use. Resolve every emitted request, including unknown
permission types. Kirie does not select trusted origins, show operating-system
prompts, or grant permissions automatically. Android and iOS do not yet emit
this signal; their application manifests and operating-system permission flows
remain separate requirements.

The [Godot CEF 1.15.3 permission API](https://github.com/dsh0416/godot-cef/blob/v1.15.3/docs/api/methods.md#permission-handling)
defines the underlying desktop request lifetime and resolver behavior.
